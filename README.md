# AlphaSudokuGo

This project takes a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) approach, implementing backtracking and consistency checks to solve Sudoku puzzles of any difficulty level.

## Features ðŸ”¢

- **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) Solver**: Leverages the CSP approach for solving puzzles, ensuring that all constraints are met before moving forward. Includes consistency checks to ensure that the puzzle is solvable.
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Implements a backtracking algorithm to navigate through the puzzle, making intelligent decisions at each step.
- **Efficient Puzzle Solving**: Designed to solve puzzles of varying difficulty levels, from simple to diabolically hard.
- **Qt5 GUI**: Provides a graphical user interface for users to interact with the solver and input their own puzzles.
- **CMake Build System**: Uses CMake to manage the build process, making it easy to compile and run the project. Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Getting Started
